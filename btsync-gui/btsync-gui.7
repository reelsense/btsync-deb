.SH NAME
btsync-gui - Private network P2P file synchronisation tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.B btsync-gui [-h] [--log {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}]
.B [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--username USERNAME]
.B [--password PASSWORD]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B BitTorrent Sync UI
is a simple tool that applies p2p protocol for direct live folder sync with
maximum security, network speed and storage capacity. It has native versions
for Mac, Windows and Linux, as well as native NAS integration.

If launched without any options, the UI starts a local BitTorrent Sync agent
in the context of the user and connects to it (standalone mode). The GUI is
divided into two main sections:

The
.B status indicator
is the central access point to BitTorrent Sync and shows information about the
current status via its icon. The context menu allows to perorm some operations
and to open the application window.

The
.B application window
allows to manage the shared folders, view the connected peers, manage the
standard and advanced preferences and connect mobile devices via QR-codes
with the connection information.

The GUI can be also be started from the command line with parameters specifying
a connection to a remote BitTorrent Sync system. In this case, the GUI does not
start a local BitTorrent Sync agent, but connects to an already running agent
at a remote location.
.B This will work only, if the remote agent has activated API access by
.B specifying a valid API key in the configuration file.
(See examples below)

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h, --help
Shows the help for the command

.TP
.B --log {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}
Sets the logging level. By default the logging level is
.B WARNING

.TP
.B --host HOST
Hostname for the connection to BitTorrent Sync. If not specified, a local
BitTorrent Sync agent will be launched.

.TP
.B --port PORT
Optional port number for the connection to BitTorrent Sync. If not specified,
port 8888 is taken for a connection to a remote BitTorrent Sync agent or (8999
+ uid) is taken when creating a locally lauched agent. This option can be made
persistent for local agents with
.B --savedefaults

.TP
.B --username USERNAME
Optional user name for connecting to a remote BitTorrent Sync agent or username
to use when creating a locally launched agent. This option can be made
persistent for local agents with
.B --savedefaults

.TP
.B --password PASSWORD
Optional password for connecting to a remote BitTorrent Sync agent or password
to use when creating a locally launched agent. This option can be made
persistent for local agents with
.B --savedefaults

.TP
.B --bindui BINDUI
Optional bind address for the Web UI of a locally created BitTorrent Sync agent.
By default the agent binds to 127.0.0.1. If you want the Web UI of the agent to
be reachable by other computers, specify one of the available IP addresses of
this computer or "all" to bind to all available adapters. This option can be
made persistent for local agents with
.B --savedefaults

.TP
.B --webui
Include the Web UI in the menu. This option can be made persistent with
.B --savedefaults

.TP
.B --dark
If specified, the dark indicator icon set will be used. This option can
be made persistent with
.B --savedefaults

.TP
.B --savedefaults
If specified, the optionally supplied credentials, bind address and port will be
stored as default in the application preferences and used when launching a local
BitTorrent Sync agent.

.TP
.B --cleardefaults
If specified, all internally stored credentials, bind address and port
information will be cleared from the application preferences.


.SH FILES

.TP
.I ~/.btsync/sync.log
User specific log file of the locally started BitTorrent Sync agent

.TP
.I ~/.config/btsync/btsync-gui.conf

agent. This file exists only for the fraction of a second and will be deleted
immediately after the process has been launched.

.TP
.I ~/.config/btsync/btsync-gui.prefs
User specific configuration file for the persistent configuration data of the
BitTorrent Sync GUI

.TP
.I ~/.config/btsync/btsync-gui.pid
User specific PID file of the BitTorrent Sync GUI

.TP
.I ~/.config/btsync/btsync-agent.pid
User specific PID file of the BitTorrent Sync agent

.SH DIRECTORIES

.TP
.I ~/.btsync
User specific storage path of the BitTorrent Sync agent

.TP
.I ~/.config/btsync
User specific configuration file path for the BitTorrent Sync agent

.SH EXAMPLES FOR STANDALONE MODE

By default there is no way to access the Web UI provided by the BitTorrent Sync
agent, since the agent itself defines at each start random credentials to
protect the system. If you still want to access the Web UI, you can activate an
extended menu option by specifying
.B --webui
on the command line. You will then have an additional menu item, that invokes a
browser and connects you to the Web UI.

If you want to make this setting persistent, you can invoke the following
command from the console:

.B btsync-gui --webui --savedefaults

This makes the setting persistent, and you will not need to specify it again at
each start.

Sometimes it may happen, that you want to access your running BitTorrent Sync
agent from another computer via the Web UI or a btsync-gui in Client Mode.
By default this is not possible, because of two reasons:

.RS
The BitTorrent Sync agent binds the administration interface only to the
loopback adapter making it possible to connect only from the same machine
(This is a security feature).

The BitTorrent Sync agent is started at every time with randomly generated
credentials. Without knowing them, it is impossible to access the administration
interface of the agent (This is also a security feature).
.RE

For users that want to access their system from another computer, there is still
a possibility to configure the GUI in a way that makes the agent accessible also
from other computers. In order to do so, the following parameters must be
changed:

.RS
The BitTorrent Sync agent must bind his administrative interface to all
adapters of the system or an adapter reachable from outside.

The BitTorrent Sync agent must bind his administrative interface to a well
known port. By default the port is the sum of 8999 and the uid of the user.

The credentials must be set to something known.
.RE

The GUI can be launched in such a mode, by specifying the following parameters:

.B btsync-gui --bindui 0.0.0.0 --port 10888 --username Leopoldo --password SuperSecret

This configures the BitTorrent Sync agent to bind on all interfaces on port
10888 and to be accessinble with the user name "Leopoldo" and the password
"SuperSecret".

Also these settings can be made persistent by adding the option
.B --savedefaults

.B WARNING:
as every comfort function, you pay the comfort by lowering the security.
Remember: the product of comfort and security is a constant. You cannot
increase both.


.SH EXAMPLES FOR CLIENT MODE

In client mode, the GUI can be used to access a remotely running BitTorrent Sync
agent. The only prerequisites are that the remote BitTorrent Sync agent is
reachable from your computer, you know the credentials and the API access is
enabled on the remote agent. You can also use the GUI to connect to another
machine where a BitTorrent Sync GUI is running in standalone mode, if you have
configured access possibilities like shown in the example above.

The connection to a remote BitTorrent Sync agent is done by entering the
following command:

.B btsync-gui --host myserver.example.com --port 8888 --username Leopoldo --password SuperSecret 

If you are able to access the Web UI of a remote BitTorrent Sync system, you
should know everything you need to also launch successfully the GUI.

Since the connection to remote systems is slower, you will notice the following
limitations:

.RS
The refresh rate is slower. It adapts dynamically to the overall performance.

During the status refreshes, the GUI may be a bit unresponsive.

There are no local file system checks, when you add a new folder. You must be
sure, that you enter a valid path on the remote machine.

Some features are disabled (Pause/resume, Enable/Disable Debug) since they are
not feasible on remote systems.
